///  Try making a scroll view of content that shows a "Back to Top" button at the top when the user is at least X points down, e.g. 150 or something. If you can make it appear only once their finger is released, even better. When the button is tapped, it should take them back to the top of the scroll view.

import SwiftUI

struct ScrollChallenge: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text(/*@START_MENU_TOKEN@*/"Hello, World!"/*@END_MENU_TOKEN@*/)
    }
}

#Preview {
    ScrollChallenge()
