///  Build a tiny app that lets users create a four-point mesh gradient. That means they get to select four colors using ColorPicker, and see the results immediately. So, they might say top-left is red, top-right is green, bottom-left is purple, and bottom-right is blue.

///  If you want to be fancy, let them specify two colors for each of the four points, then use color mixing and an animation or TimelineView to move between the mesh gradients – a constant, in-flux flow of gradients.

    var body: some View {
        Text(/*@START_MENU_TOKEN@*/"Hello, World!"/*@END_MENU_TOKEN@*/)
